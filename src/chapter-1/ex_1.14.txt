For loop held more advantages than the while loop

1. Easier to understand the code
2. We often forget updating the loop index variable in a while loop. This can't happen when using for.
3. Allows declaration of loop index variable in the init-statement of the header part thus limiting the scope of the index variable.
4. Each part of the for loop's header is only optional, thereby allowing more flexiblity to implement more algorithms.
