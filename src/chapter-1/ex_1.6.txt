std::cout << "The sum of " << v1; 
          << " and " << v2;
          << " is " << v1 + v2 << std::endl;


This program fragment is illegal. Semi-colons mark the end of the statement, so the cout object won't be available
in the subsequent lines. Removing the semi-colons from line 1 and 2 should fix the program.
